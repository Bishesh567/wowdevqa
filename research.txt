	3 stages:
	1) Data collection and preprocessing
	2) pattern discovery
	3) pattern analysis

	   a) Data cleaning
	   b) pageview identification
	   c) sessionizatin
	   d) Data transformation
		i) Data integration
		ii) Data aggregation
		iii) Data generalizatioin

Source of Data
1) Web server log file(ip, resource name, browser, os, refered field)
2) Application server logs

We obtain four type of data
1) usage data(primary source of data)
   - count the number of times hit the website
